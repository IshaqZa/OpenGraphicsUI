# Senior Project: Cheater
### introduction
This project is an implementation of a game that will be called **Cheater**, which follows the hacking adventure of a school kid that failed most of his classes and wants to alter all his grades by hacking the school database. You as the player will be controlling the avatar of this kid's digital presence. This avatar will be shooting, hacking and slashing his way through the security systems that have been set by the school against intruders.

### Project Setup, development environment and resources
The following resources have been used to set up and aid in the development of the project:
- **Integrated Development Environment(IDE)**: Visual Studio Code
- **Building platform(+compiler)**: MSYS2* the gcc compiler
- **Version Control**: Github and git
- **API**: OpenGL(Open Graphics Library)
- **Libraries**:
    - GLFW: Utility Library for OpenGL
    - GLAD: "Function loader" which reduces the amount of code that has to be written and helps with cross-compatibility

*MSYS2: is a software distribution platform developed for Microsoft Windows and offers the Unix development environment for Windows OS users
